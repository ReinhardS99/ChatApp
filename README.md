# Production
This program was an assignment of the CMPG315 module that we created. It works as an application to communicate over a network on different machines.

## Approach 
Our program was designed to work on two different machines that were connected to the internet and send messages back and forth. Once the line is closed it will terminate the program and the messages will be lost.
